# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Include all relevant roles (Developers, QA, UX Designer, DevOps/Release Engineer, Support Lead, Business Analyst) to get comprehensive perspective
- Focus on cross-role handoffs and collaboration — use [Role Handoff Checklist](octoacme-role-handoff-checklist.md) to identify improvement opportunities

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Share learnings across teams and roles
- Update process documentation (including [Role Handoff Checklist](octoacme-role-handoff-checklist.md)) based on retrospective insights
- Encourage feedback from all roles, especially around handoff efficiency and cross-role collaboration

# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Plan role handoffs and collaboration touchpoints (see [Role Handoff Checklist](octoacme-role-handoff-checklist.md))
8. Coordinate design reviews with UX Designer if applicable
9. Establish deployment strategy with DevOps/Release Engineer
10. Define support readiness criteria with Support Lead
